Video title: Welcome to the Open Science MOOC

Presenters: Jon Tennant, Lisa Hehnke, Valentina Goglio, Bianca Kramer, Paola Masuzzo, Chris Hartgerink, Jo Havemann, Julien Colomb, Christopher Madan, Ivo Grigorov, Ricardo Hartley Belmar, Rutger Vos, Tobias Steiner, Nicolas Schmelling. 

# Background

The intention of this video is to explain to learners what the Open Science MOOC is, how it came about, and why it might be useful for them.

# Script

Ricardo: Our world is facing huge challenges. From preserving life on land and combating the threat of climate change, to providing food and energy security for a rapidly growing global population. It has never been more important in all of human history that we make sure we are using scientific research to help to mitigate these major challenges of our time.

Lisa: But are we using scientific research as effectively as we can? The simple answer is, no, we are not. Most scientific research remains inaccessible to most people on this planet. Researchers selectively communicate their results, in the hope of gaining prestige by publishing in the top scientific journals. Data, code, materials, and other critical elements of the research process remain locked away on harddrives, never to see the light of day. We are still largely using analog methods of communication within the digital age, where we have the enormous power of Web-based technologies to share and collaborate on knowledge like never before. But we are not using this power.

Nicholas: Enter Open Science. Open Science means many things to different people. Broadly, it can be thought of as transparent and collaborative ways to produce and share scholarly knowledge, while making the scientific process more rigorous and effective. 

Jo: While 'openness' has always been a fundamental part of research, ideally at least, Open Science has really taken off over the last few years, all around the world. We now have new ecpectations about how to work with each other to produce knowledge - more transparent, more collaborative, more continuous - and how to share that with the wider society.

Jon: This is where the Open Science MOOC comes in. We are a mission-driven project to help make "Open" the default setting for all global research. We want to help create a welcoming and supporting community, with good tools, teachers, and role-models, and built upon a solid values-based foundation of freedom and equitable access to research. Therefore, we see Open Science as a goal: broad adoption of good scientific practices as a fundamental and essential part of the research process.

Valentina: How are we working to achieve this? MOOC traditionally stands for 'Massively Open Online Course'. While the core of what we do is about producing learning materials in a course-like structure, we feel the C in MOOC better stands for community. This more accurately reflects the more peer-to-peer and engaging style of learning with each other that we try to promote.

Ivo: What we are building then is a community of practice. We should be training ourselves to adapt to this new digital age of research. We are doing this through sustained community engagement across all research disciplines. We are constantly evolving and adapting, changing our practices and mindsets, and challenging the flaws of the older research system.

Julien: We have a vision of the future, where research is defined by the values inherent to Open Science, such as freedom and equity. Science should be a freely available, public good. It should be rigorous and reproducible. It should be open to all. This is not 'Open' science, this is just good science. But we cannot achieve this alone. We need everyone to be working together if we are going to help to solve the major challenges that we face. We need science to work better for society.

Bianca: Our mission is to help the global research community to do this. How? We will help to equip them with new knowledge and skills to save time and effort, making their research more efficient. By solving problems better together, we can advance research faster, and put it to better use. 

Rutger: The content and material we will provide will hopefully help shape an ecosystem of researchers more and more attentive to research equity, democratization, inclusiveness and open collaboration. By solving problems better together, we can advance research faster, and put it to better use.

Tobias: Everything we produce is freely available, and openly licensed for re-use. It is all built in the open by a passionate community of developers. We place no restrictions on who can use what we produce, or who can join us in building it.

Paola (and anyone else you can get locally to shout this?): Researchers can be world-changing heroes. We will give them the power to achieve that. [No capes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFW2msxP6Q)
